# CS360-2024C-6 Project Three

## Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

- The Weight Tracking App helps users keep track of their weight and stay motivated with their fitness goals. It lets users log their weight daily, sends SMS reminders, and shows progress with clear table. The goal was to make a simple and helpful tool that encourages users to stay consistent.

## What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app?

- The app includes key screens like a Sign-Up Screen for new accounts, a Login Screen, and a Home Screen where users can log their weight or check their progress. The app also has an SMS reminder feature to keep users on track. The design is simple with minimal colors and clear navigation so users can easily find what they need.

## How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

- The design focused on being simple and easy to use. Screens were uncluttered and users could quickly navigate between features. By focusing on the most important user needs, the app became engaging and effective. 

## How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use?

- I worked on one feature at a time like login or SMS notifications and tested each part as I went. I used Firebase for secure data storage and Android permissions for SMS. Breaking the app into smaller tasks made development smoother and this method is something Iâ€™ll use in future projects.

## How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

- I tested the app on an Android Emulator to see how it works on different devices. Each feature like login and notifications was tested separately to catch and fix errors. Testing made sure everything worked as planned and helped me find and fix small bugs before finishing the app.

## Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

- The SMS notification system was challenging because I needed to request only essential permissions. Creating a simple but effective UI was another challenge. Breaking these tasks into smaller steps and testing often helped me solve these problems.

## In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

- The most successful part of the app was integrating Firebase for secure login and data storage. This showed my ability to build a reliable system. The user-friendly UI design also stood out because it made the app easy to use and visually appealing.
